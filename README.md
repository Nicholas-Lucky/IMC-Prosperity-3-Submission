## Overview
#### [IMC's Prosperity 2025](https://prosperity.imc.com/) is an annual trading challenge that challenges participants to program an algorithm to trade various goods on a virtual trading market â€” with the goal of gaining as much profit, in the form of seashells, as possible. In addition to the algorithm, there are manual trading challenges that allow participants to gain additional seashells. The competition spans five rounds, with each round adding new products for our trading algorithms to consider, and a new manual trading challenge to attempt. This year is the third iteration of the competition (Prosperity 3), and lasted from April 7th, 2025 to April 22nd, 2025. This is our first year in the competition, and we focused on learning and gaining a (at least) general understanding of the competition and the programming and skills required to perform in both the trading algorithm and manual trading challenges.

#### Further details on this year's competition can be found on the [Prosperity 3 Wiki](https://imc-prosperity.notion.site/Prosperity-3-Wiki-19ee8453a09380529731c4e6fb697ea4).
